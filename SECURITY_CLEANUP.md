# Security Cleanup Report

## ⚠️ MALICIOUS CODE REMOVED

This repository contained malicious code that has been removed. Here's what was cleaned up:

### Removed Malicious Components:

1. **web3-layout-helpers package** (v2.0.3)
   - **Risk**: Hosted on GitLab instead of NPM registry
   - **Function**: `initializeSession()` - designed to steal private keys
   - **Status**: ✅ REMOVED from package.json

2. **keypairEncryption() function**
   - **Risk**: Called malicious `initializeSession()` with private key
   - **Status**: ✅ REPLACED with safe `validatePrivateKey()` function

3. **Hardcoded API Keys**
   - **Risk**: Exposed real API keys in .env.example
   - **Status**: ✅ REPLACED with placeholder values

### What Was Preserved:

✅ Core Solana trading bot functionality
✅ Legitimate Raydium pool monitoring
✅ Token buying/selling logic
✅ Stop loss/take profit features
✅ Snipe list functionality
✅ All legitimate dependencies

### Next Steps:

1. **Run `npm install`** to install clean dependencies
2. **Create your own .env file** based on .env.example with your own keys
3. **Use only trusted RPC endpoints** (Helius, QuickNode, etc.)
4. **Never use this code before this cleanup** - previous versions steal private keys

### Safe Usage:

The bot is now safe to use. The malicious code has been completely removed while preserving all legitimate trading functionality.

**⚠️ WARNING**: If you ran this code BEFORE this cleanup, check your wallets immediately for unauthorized transactions and consider moving funds to new wallets.
